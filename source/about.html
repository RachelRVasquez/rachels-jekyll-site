<h2 class="about-heading">I have 5+ years of front-end experience with a heavy focus on accessibility. I also have a knack for event tracking with Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.</h2> 

<p>I have worked primarily with agencies over the years and stuck my hands into several project types, ranging from Code Igniter to CMS' and E-Commerce platforms. I've built everything from HTML email templates, static HTML sites and themes across several platforms like Tumblr, Shopify, Magento and WordPress to name a few. WordPress is what opened the door to back-end languages for me and it is there where I discovered my love for PHP. I'd love to take on a role where I can strengthen this skill and continue pushing myself towards being a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>On my spare time, I'm an active member of the WordPress community, also a technical and creative writer. My blog (rachievee) is where I write WordPress tutorials, and you can check out <a href="https://rachelsfloetry.com/" target="_blank">Rachel's Floetry</a> for some of my more creative stuff.</p>

<h3 class="about-heading">I am currently seeking short term freelance or contract positions so that I can build up my portfolio with projects that aren't solely agency owned.</h3> 

<p>I am, however, still interested in a full-time position as well. Remote is preferred, but I'm open to commute with a company that has a healty work-life balance and flexible schedules. You can reach me via my <a href="{{ site.author.linkedin }}" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>, Twitter, my blog - just about anywhere.</p>

<p>PS: If you're curious where the cartoon logo came from - I drew it. Little hobby of mine.</p>
